# Inbound-Capacity-Forecasting

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was to develop an inbound capacity forecasting model using machine learning algorithms (Regression, XGBoost, LSTM) on large time series data, enabling the identification of incoming order peaks and driving inventory strategy. As part of this project, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model optimization, and hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation and grid search were conducted to ensure accurate and reliable capacity forecasts, achieving the best possible performance.
